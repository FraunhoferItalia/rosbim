# ROSBIM

Authors: Tobit Flatscher, [Michael Terzer](michael.terzer@fraunhofer.it) Fraunhofer Italia 2022-2024

ROSBIM is an interface from ROS 2 to Building Information Modeling (BIM). Explore in depth every directory/package to get to know more. Especially the metapackage  
ROSBIM contains ReadMe's about the code design and contribution-guidelines.

# Installation and usage

This README contains the few basic steps to install and run an example of ROSBIM.

## Installation

The repository comes with a docker setup that is divided into two containers. The base container contains installations of IfcOpenShell, OpenCollada, OCCT and pythonocc-core from source. The compilation of these repositories is time intensive wherefore the prebuild image can be pulled from the dockerhub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fraunhoferitalia/rosbim).
Once the base image has been pulled or build, start the application container by:
```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose-app.yml up
```

### Run an example

The repository comes with an example setup that launches the rosbim_manager, two rosbim plugins, a map_server and an RViz2 instance.

```
colcon build && source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch rosbim_example_models crane_hall_v10.launch.py
```
