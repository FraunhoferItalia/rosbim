# rosbim_pluginsÂ 

Author(s): Tobit Flatscher (March 2022)

## Description

This folder holds several plugins for ROSBIM similar to the standard `ros_controllers` package for `ros_control` that might be extended with custom plug-ins using the basic functionality of the underlying `bim_interface` library. If additional functionality is required the `bim_interface` library should be extended. Each plug-in should supply its own messages.
